# Project
This is the first game of all the others you see in my repository.

I have done Tetris years ago , however i lost the codes and it wasn't fully complete as a game anyway.

The game is pretty simple and i am not going to add any crazy flavor to it, rather treat it like a warm up after serving two years of national service.

# Tools and Resources

* IntelliJ IDEA - IDE used for the project
* LibGDX - Framework used the game

# Rules


# Logics

# Timeline (when i remember to update)

### 2017-08-31 16:40 Writing the codes for the settings, such as desktop window sizes, saving and retrieving of user settings etc.
